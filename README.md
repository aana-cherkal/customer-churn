# customer-churn
This project uses telecom customer data to predict whether a customer will churn.
--trained and compared multiple models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, and SVM to find the best-performing classifier

Problem Statement
Predict the likelihood of customer churn using:

Contract type, tenure, payment method

Security and internet services

Monthly charges and total charges

Customer demographics

Techniques Used
Data Cleaning (Handled nulls, removed unnecessary columns)

Feature Scaling + One-Hot Encoding

Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, SVM

Model comparison and evaluation

Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

Confusion Matrix

Key Takeaways
Logistic Regression had the most balanced performance

Decision Tree slightly overfit the training data

KNN and SVM struggled due to high dimensionality

Dataset
Telecom customer dataset with 20+ features covering service usage, billing, and customer info.
