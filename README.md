Customer Churn Prediction using Logistic Regression
This project uses telecom customer data to predict churn. Trained and evaluated multiple models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, and SVM to identify the best-performing classifier.

Problem Statement
Predict whether a customer is likely to churn using:

Contract type, payment method, tenure

Presence of security services

Internet service and monthly charges

Customer demographics and account info

Techniques Used
Data Cleaning (Handled nulls, dropped irrelevant columns)

Label Encoding & One-Hot Encoding

Feature Scaling

Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, SVM

Model comparison and evaluation

Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

Confusion Matrix

Key Takeaways
Logistic Regression showed the most balanced precision and recall

Decision Tree slightly overfit the training data

KNN and SVM underperformed due to high dimensionality

Key churn factors: contract type, missing security services, payment method

Dataset
Telecom customer dataset with demographics, account details, and service usage patterns.
